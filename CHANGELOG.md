# Changelog

## 1.0.2 — 2026-05-27

### Added
- **`/test-audit` command** — inline diagnostic for test coverage gaps; covers scope detection, framework auto-detect (Jest, Vitest, pytest, Go, RSpec, Rust), source-to-test mapping, empty test file check, framework config check, and CI test step check; severity: [HIGH] missing, [MEDIUM] empty/CI gap, [LOW] no framework/config/CI
- **`/health-check` command** — PMB-specific repo health check; runs `mb doctor` + `mb validate` + `mb audit` and prints a labeled summary with overall status (PMB repo only, not distributed via `mb init`)
- **`docs/COMMANDS-REFERENCE.md`** — comprehensive reference for all `mb` CLI commands, slash commands, Claude Code built-in commands, and `mb doctor` check details

### Fixed
- `mb upgrade` now includes `.claude/commands/test-audit.md` in `$templateOwned` so adopted projects receive the test-audit command on upgrade
- README version badge corrected from `1.0.0` to `1.0.2`

---

## 1.0.1 — 2026-05-27

### Fixed
- Stop hook documentation: heading now reads "excluded from install template"; clarified that PMB's own `.claude/settings.json` keeps it deliberately for interactive Windows sessions
- Contract threshold: raised from "more than one file" to "4 or more files" with sensitive-domain list
- Compaction/handoff language: corrected numerically backwards sentence about 50%/40% thresholds
- CI workflow renamed: `governance.yml` → `pmb-health.yml`; internal `name:` updated to "PMB Health"

## 1.0.0 — 2026-05-14

First stable personal release. Crossed from "organized prompt files" into governed operational memory infrastructure.

### Added
- **Authority hierarchy** — deterministic conflict resolution between memory-bank files (immutable → stable → volatile → accumulating)
- **3-dimension frontmatter** — `review-cycle`, `retention`, `staleness-threshold` replacing a coarse single `ttl` field
- **Hierarchical tags** — `domain/concept` format (`auth/session`, `infra/postgres`) replacing flat tags
- **Automated `last-reviewed`** — PostToolUse hook updates frontmatter whenever a memory-bank file is edited
- **Partitioned archive** — `docs/archive/context/`, `docs/archive/progress/`, `docs/archive/decisions/` replacing a single monolithic ARCHIVE.md
- **`mb audit`** — freshness audit flagging stale and overdue files by staleness-threshold
- **`mb query`** — tag-based retrieval with partial hierarchical matching
- **`mb compact`** — AI-driven compaction prompt for deduplication and summarization
- **`mb init`** — zero-config project initializer with checkmark UX
- **`mb validate`** — required-file and frontmatter health check
- **`mb doctor`** — full diagnostic (git, templates, hooks, file sizes, handoff state)
- **`mb budget`** — token overhead check (CLAUDE.md + memory-bank/ sizes)
- **Worktree guard** — `mb commit` refuses mutations from git subworktrees
- **`install.bat`** — Windows double-click installer (sets MB_HOME, registers `mb` globally)
- **`install.sh`** — Mac/Linux installer (sets MB_HOME in shell rc, registers `mb` globally)
- **`scripts/update-reviewed.ps1` + `.sh`** — PostToolUse hook scripts for auto last-reviewed
- **AGENTIC-SAFETY.md** — indirect prompt injection defense and task boundary standard
- **`task-boundary.md` template** — agentic session scoping

### Changed
- **README** — rewritten outcomes-first with progressive disclosure (advanced features behind collapsible sections)
- **MEMORY-BANK.md** — added authority tiers, eviction criteria, archive structure, worktree guidance, tag-based retrieval, and memory compaction sections
- **Archive strategy** — all references to monolithic `docs/ARCHIVE.md` replaced with partitioned `docs/archive/`
- **`mb help`** — reorganized with new commands listed first; examples added

### Removed
- Monolithic archive pattern (`docs/ARCHIVE.md`) — replaced by partitioned subdirectories
