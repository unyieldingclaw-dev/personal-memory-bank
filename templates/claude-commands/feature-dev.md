description: Run the full structured feature development workflow
---

Run the 7-phase feature development workflow in order. Do not skip phases. Do not move to the next phase until the current phase is complete and approved.

**Phase 1 — Brainstorm**
Invoke superpowers:brainstorming. Explore the codebase, ask clarifying questions one at a time, propose 2–3 approaches with trade-offs, get design approved before writing any code.

**Phase 2 — Spec**
Write the validated design to `docs/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`. Self-review for TBDs, contradictions, and ambiguity. Get user approval.

**Phase 3 — Plan**

Draft the implementation plan in `.claude/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-slug>.md`. This file is gitignored — it is a scratch draft, not a durable artifact.

After presenting the plan and receiving user approval, promote it:
```
mb plan promote .claude/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-slug>.md
```

Do not commit `.claude/plans/` files. Do not load all plans at session start.

**Phase 3.5 — Independent Plan Review (advisory, not one of the 7 phases — does not count against "do not skip phases")**
For plans with real consequence: dispatch a fresh Agent with no context from writing the plan, on a capable model, to verify it against its spec and the current repo state. Fix `Blocking: true` findings; disclose others. See `standards/WORKFLOW.md` for the full mechanism.

**Phase 4 — Implement**
Execute the plan using superpowers:subagent-driven-development (preferred) or superpowers:executing-plans. TDD: write failing test → implement → verify passing → commit after each unit.

**Phase 5 — Simplify**
Invoke code-simplifier on all changed files. Improve clarity and consistency without changing behavior.

**Phase 6 — Security Review**
Run /security-review on the current diff. Resolve all [CRITICAL] and [HIGH] findings before proceeding.

**Phase 7 — Commit**
```bash
git add <specific changed files>
git commit -m "feat: <what was built and why>"
```
