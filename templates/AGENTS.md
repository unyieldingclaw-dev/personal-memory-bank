# AI Coding Rules

## Memory Bank

At the start of every session, and again after any context compaction, if `memory-bank/` exists in the project root:
1. Read `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` — non-negotiable requirements and constraints
2. Read `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` — architecture decisions and patterns to follow
3. Read `memory-bank/techContext.md` — tech stack, dependencies, environment
4. Read `memory-bank/activeContext.md` — current focus and next steps
5. Read `memory-bank/progress.md` — what is complete and planned

Treat Memory Bank as authoritative for priority and rationale. Never ask for information already in Memory Bank. Never violate constraints in projectbrief.md.
Never write secrets, credentials, API keys, PII, production data, or full code dumps to memory-bank/ files.

At session end, before a planned compaction, or when the user reports context at or above 40%:
1. Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` — current state, key decisions, blockers
2. Update `memory-bank/progress.md` — what shipped, what is queued
3. Create `handoff.md` only when ephemeral in-flight state is not already captured in Memory Bank

The 40% threshold is a proactive fallback, not proof that every tool exposes a native blocking event.

## Platform Compaction Support

- **Claude Code:** `.claude/settings.json` runs an executable `PreCompact` gate that can block compaction until Memory Bank state is current.
- **Codex:** `.codex/hooks.json` runs only a `SessionStart` recovery hook for `source: compact`; it deliberately has no turn-terminating `PreCompact` gate. Project hooks run only after the exact hook definition is trusted in `/hooks`; local feature or managed-policy settings can disable them.
- **Cursor:** `.cursor/rules/memory-bank.mdc` provides an always-applied advisory workflow. Cursor's native `preCompact` event is observational and cannot block or modify compaction, so the user-reported 40% trigger remains proactive rather than enforced.

## Verification-First

Before implementing: state test cases, expected output, or success criteria upfront.
This is the single highest-leverage habit for improving output quality.

## Security Guardrails

Three tiers — `standards/SECURITY-GUARDRAILS.md` has the full enumerated lists.

- **BLOCK** (refuse): committing secrets, force-push to main/master, destructive system commands, exposing secrets in logs, unverified package recommendations (slopsquatting), hardcoded credentials.
- **CONFIRM** (ask first): deletions, file overwrites without reading, bulk ops on >3 files, `git commit --amend`, `--no-verify`, force-push to any branch, interactive rebase, `DROP`/`DELETE` without `WHERE`/`TRUNCATE`, schema changes, edits to `*auth*`/`*security*`/`*permission*`, CI/CD config changes.
- **WARN** (note the risk): >5 files or >200 lines, new files, missing tests, skipping verification.

## Workflow

Always follow this sequence for any non-trivial feature:

1. **Brainstorm** — Understand requirements, explore codebase, propose 2–3 approaches, get design approved before writing code
2. **Spec** — Write the validated design to `docs/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`
3. **Plan** — Create a bite-sized implementation plan with exact file paths and complete code
4. **Implement** — TDD: write failing test → implement → verify passing → commit
5. **Simplify** — Review changed code for clarity and consistency without changing behavior
6. **Security Review** — Scan diff for secrets, injection, XSS, and related patterns; see `standards/SECURITY-GUARDRAILS.md`
7. **Commit** — Stage and commit with a descriptive message

**Skip to step 4** for: single-file fixes, typos, config changes, or changes < 20 lines.

## Code Quality

- Never hardcode secrets — use environment variables or a secrets manager
- Validate inputs only at system boundaries (user input, external APIs)
- Remove dead code before committing — no unused functions, variables, or imports
- Each function does one thing
- Default to no comments — only add one when the WHY is non-obvious
- Run tests and report results before claiming done
- **UI code only:** apply WCAG 2.1 AA basics (semantic HTML, alt text, form labels, keyboard nav)

## Handoff Protocol

When the user types "Handoff" or reports context at or above 40%:
1. STOP all work immediately
2. Verify `memory-bank/activeContext.md` and `memory-bank/progress.md` are current; update them first if needed
3. CREATE `handoff.md` only for ephemeral in-flight state: interrupted file/line, uncommitted diff, non-default process state, the next command, and a pointer to `activeContext.md` for priority
4. RESPOND only: "Handoff ready at `handoff.md`. Start a new conversation."
5. STOP — do not continue

After compaction or when starting a new conversation:
1. Re-read all five Memory Bank files first; do not rely on a compaction summary
2. Read `handoff.md` second if present, treating it only as an ephemeral supplement
3. Reconcile it with `activeContext.md`'s Next Steps and surface any conflict
4. Verify the current git branch/worktree, uncommitted diff, running services, and next test before resuming
5. Merge any durable information into Memory Bank, delete the spent `handoff.md`, and resume from the verified state
