#!/usr/bin/env sh
# PreToolUse hook — blocks git commit/push until the matching review slash command has run,
# and unconditionally blocks `gh pr merge` outright. /code-review writes
# .claude/.code-review-ok on an Approve verdict; /change-review writes .claude/.change-review-ok
# when no finding is Blocking. Each marker authorizes exactly one commit or push attempt for a
# SPECIFIC diff -- see below.
#
# WHY `gh pr merge` gets an unconditional deny instead of a third diff-bound marker: by the
# time a PR is mergeable, its diff already passed the commit gate, the push gate, and (per
# branch protection's required-status-checks with strict:true) CI on the current head -- a
# third hash gate here would mostly re-verify what's already verified, while adding real
# fragility (PR-number/--repo parsing, a `gh pr diff` API call inside a hook). The actual gap
# at merge time isn't diff integrity, it's authorization: merging changes shared history and
# should never happen without the user deciding to do it in that moment, and a hash can't
# encode "the user meant this right now." This hook can only ever see commands *this agent*
# runs -- the user's own terminal is invisible to it -- so an unconditional deny is both
# correct and total: if this hook fires at all, it's the agent trying to merge, never the
# user, so there is no legitimate case to allow through.
#
# WHY the marker holds a SHA-256 hash of the reviewed diff, not an empty file: an empty
# marker is trivially fakeable with `touch` -- anyone (or a rushed agent) can satisfy the
# gate without actually reviewing anything. Binding the marker to a hash of the exact diff
# means it only authorizes committing/pushing that SPECIFIC diff; if the working tree
# changes after the review, the hash no longer matches and the gate re-engages.
#
# WHY the marker is consumed via an atomic rename (mv), not a separate [ -f ] + rm: check-
# then-delete has a TOCTOU window between the two steps. mv's underlying rename is a single
# filesystem operation -- if the source doesn't exist, the move simply fails, collapsing
# "does it exist" and "claim it" into one step.
#
# WHY this also records a pre-state SHA before consuming the marker: see the companion
# PostToolUse hook (review-reminders-post.sh) -- if the gated commit/push then fails, that
# hook detects the relevant git ref didn't move and reissues the marker, so a rejected
# attempt (e.g. a separate pre-commit hook) doesn't force a pointless re-review.
#
# WHY match raw stdin instead of extracting the "command" field: a `grep -o
# '"command":"[^"]*"'` extraction breaks on any JSON-escaped quote inside the command,
# silently truncating the match and letting anything after it through unchecked. Since
# "git commit"/"git push" only plausibly appear in this hook's stdin inside the command
# field, matching the raw payload directly is robust to that escaping edge case.
#
# WHY hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision, not top-level "continue": top-level
# {"continue": false} only stops the agent's turn *after* the tool call has already run --
# it does not prevent execution. Verified empirically with a real git commit.
#
# WHY sha256sum with a shasum fallback: sha256sum is standard on Linux and in Git for
# Windows' bundled coreutils, but macOS ships shasum instead. If neither is available,
# fail open (skip the gate entirely) rather than deny everything -- matches this repo's
# established "fail open on missing dependency" convention (see check-contract.sh/python3).
#
# WHY hash a file written via redirection, not piped/captured output: this hook is a
# fallback that only runs when pwsh is unavailable (settings.json tries pwsh first), but
# on any machine where BOTH pwsh and bash exist, a marker written by one must validate
# under the other's hook -- whichever runs is a coin flip the writer can't control. Piping
# `git diff | sha256sum` preserves the trailing newline; capturing via `$(git diff ...)`
# strips it. review-reminders.ps1 redirects to a file (`>`), which also preserves it.
# Hashing a redirected file here, instead of piping or capturing, makes this script's hash
# byte-identical to review-reminders.ps1's for the same diff, regardless of which one
# actually enforces the gate on a given machine. Empirically confirmed: command
# substitution and redirect-to-file produced different SHA-256 hashes for the same diff
# (differing by exactly the trailing newline byte) before this fix.

sha256_file() {
    file="$1"
    if command -v sha256sum >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        sha256sum "$file" | cut -d' ' -f1
    elif command -v shasum >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        shasum -a 256 "$file" | cut -d' ' -f1

# WHY this helper: the commit and push cases below both need "redirect a git diff to a temp
# file, hash it, clean up" -- inlining that 4 times (2 here, 2 more in the companion
# review-reminders-post.sh) risked exactly the kind of copy-paste drift that caused the
# original trailing-newline bug. One helper, one place to get it right.
#
# WHY return git diff's exit code, not the hash computation's: the push case needs to try
# `origin/main...HEAD` and fall back to `HEAD` if that ref doesn't exist (no upstream). The
# caller decides whether to fall back based on whether the underlying `git diff` succeeded,
# not whether hashing succeeded (sha256_file degrades gracefully to an empty string on its
# own, unrelated failure mode) -- so this returns git diff's own exit code via `$rc`,
# captured before sha256_file has a chance to run and overwrite `$?`.
#
# WHY the trap: without it, a script exit between `mktemp` and the final `rm -f` (e.g. an
# unexpected signal) leaks a temp file. `trap - EXIT` clears it again once this function
# returns normally, since sh traps are shell-global, not function-scoped -- otherwise this
# trap would still be armed (harmlessly, but confusingly) for the rest of the script.
