# warn-stale-review-marker.ps1 — PreToolUse hook for Write/Edit (PowerShell)
#
# WHY this exists: a review-gate marker (.claude/.code-review-ok or
# .claude/.change-review-ok) is bound to a SHA-256 hash of `git diff HEAD` (or
# `origin/main...HEAD`) taken at review time. Any edit to any tracked file
# changes that diff and silently invalidates the marker -- but the only place
# that currently notices is review-reminders.ps1, at the moment of the NEXT
# `git commit`/`git push` attempt, which can be many edits later. This hook
# surfaces that fact immediately, before the edit happens, instead of after.
#
# WHY warn-only, no permissionDecision/deny: the actual enforcement already
# exists and is airtight -- review-reminders.ps1 recomputes the hash fresh at
# commit/push time and denies on any mismatch. A present-but-stale marker is
# already rejected exactly the same as an absent one, so this hook adds zero
# new safety. It only makes visible, before the edit, what would otherwise
# only be discovered after a failed commit attempt. Matches check-contract.ps1's
# established warn-only pattern in this repo (plain message, exit 0, no
# permission decision).
#
# WHY no marker deletion: review-reminders.ps1's marker consumption is the
# sole writer/reader of these files, via an atomic rename specifically to
# avoid a TOCTOU race. Adding a second deletion path here would be a second
# writer to the same security-relevant file for zero safety benefit -- a
# stale marker is already functionally equivalent to no marker at all at
# enforcement time.
#
# WHY no per-file matching: the marker's hash covers the whole `git diff
# HEAD`/`origin/main...HEAD`, not a specific file list -- any tracked-file
# edit invalidates it, so checking whether THIS edit's file is "in the diff"
# would be solving a problem that doesn't exist. Marker presence alone is the
# entire condition -- this script does not inspect the edited file at all, so
# it also fires (harmlessly, since it's a warning) on edits outside the repo
# or to untracked files, which never actually touch the hashed diff.

param()

# WHY: same outer-trap-to-log convention as check-contract.ps1, so unexpected
# errors surface via `mb doctor` instead of silently vanishing.
