"""Decide whether a payload the classifier already labelled MERGE may be put to the user.

Called by review-reminders.sh only after the classifier returned MERGE. Prints exactly:

    ASK            or    DENY
    <reason>             <reason>
    <audit line>         (nothing)

and exits 0. The hook treats anything other than a first line of exactly ASK -- a crash, a
missing file, no python3 -- as deny, so every failure here fails closed. The specific cause of
a precondition deny goes to stderr only; see GENERIC_DENY for why.

Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-20-merge-gate-user-approval-design.md (section 5). The
PowerShell twin is _review-gate-merge.ps1; the two must agree on every fixture in
tests/test-merge-gate.sh.

WHY a whole-command match on the raw string instead of reusing the classifier's segments: the
classifier answers "does this invoke a guarded verb", so it splits on ; & | and newlines,
lifts $(...) and backticks into nested segments, skips VAR= prefixes and wrapper words, and
accepts any path ending in gh. Any of those would let `<canonical merge>; <anything>` pass as
canonical while the prompt describes only the merge.

WHY no \\A / \\z: Python before 3.14 rejects \\z as a bad escape (measured on 3.11.9), and
re.fullmatch already anchors both ends without accepting a trailing newline, which $ would.
