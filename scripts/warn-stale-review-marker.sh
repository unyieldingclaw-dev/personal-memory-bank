#!/usr/bin/env sh
# warn-stale-review-marker.sh — PreToolUse hook for Write/Edit.
#
# WHY this exists: a review-gate marker (.claude/.code-review-ok or
# .claude/.change-review-ok) is bound to a SHA-256 hash of `git diff HEAD` (or
# `origin/main...HEAD`) taken at review time. Any edit to a tracked file
# changes that diff and silently invalidates the marker -- but the only place
# that currently notices is review-reminders.sh, at the moment of the NEXT
# `git commit`/`git push` attempt, which can be many edits later. This hook
# surfaces that fact immediately, before the edit happens, instead of after.
#
# WHY warn-only, no permissionDecision/deny: the actual enforcement already
# exists and is airtight -- review-reminders.sh recomputes the hash fresh at
# commit/push time and denies on any mismatch. A present-but-stale marker is
# already rejected exactly the same as an absent one, so this hook adds zero
# new safety. It only makes visible, before the edit, what would otherwise
# only be discovered after a failed commit attempt.
#
# WHY additionalContext JSON, not a plain message: a PreToolUse hook's plain
# stdout goes only to Claude Code's debug log, so the plain "Note:" this hook
# printed reached no one -- defeating its only purpose. additionalContext reaches
# the model (measured 2026-10-14). Model-only, no systemMessage: it is advice for
# the agent about to edit, and it fires on every edit while a marker exists.
# One object even with both markers present: stdout must be nothing but one
# object, or Claude Code ignores it.
#
# WHY no marker deletion: review-reminders.sh's consume_marker() is the sole
# writer/reader of these files, via an atomic `mv` specifically to avoid a
# TOCTOU race (see review-reminders.sh's own comments). Adding a second
# deletion path here would be a second writer to the same security-relevant
# file for zero safety benefit -- see the point above: a stale marker is
# already functionally equivalent to no marker at all at enforcement time.
#
# WHY no per-file matching: the marker's hash covers the whole `git diff
# HEAD`/`origin/main...HEAD`, not a specific file list -- any tracked-file
# edit invalidates it, so checking whether THIS edit's file is "in the diff"
# would be solving a problem that doesn't exist. Marker presence alone is the
# entire condition -- this script does not inspect the edited file at all, so
# it also fires (harmlessly, since it's a warning) on edits outside the repo
# or to untracked files, which never actually touch the hashed diff.
#
# Reads stdin only to consume the hook payload cleanly; the check itself
# doesn't need any field from it.
