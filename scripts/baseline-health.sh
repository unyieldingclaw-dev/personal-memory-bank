#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/baseline-health.sh — run this repo's deterministic CI checks locally.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the review commands (`/code-review`, `/change-review`) each carried a prose
# description of which CI checks to run and how. That is a transcription of logic, re-performed by
# hand on every review, and it was measurably unreliable: reproducing the spec placeholder scan
# correctly requires a 20-line awk function with a fence-parity guard and a per-line backtick-parity
# guard, and an orchestrator's naive `grep` reimplementation reported 3 false positives on a clean
# tree. Transcribed CI *numbers* had already bitten this repo three times (see
# tests/test-threshold-parity.sh's header); transcribed CI *logic* is the same defect one level up.
#
# WHY EXTRACTION RATHER THAN REIMPLEMENTATION: this script does not contain a copy of any check. It
# locates each step by name in .github/workflows/pmb-health.yml, lifts the body of its `run:` block,
# and executes that verbatim. The workflow stays the single source of truth, so a threshold or
# pattern changed there takes effect here on the next run with no edit to this file. Nothing in this
# script needs updating when a cap is ratcheted.
#
# WHY AN EMPTY EXTRACTION IS A HARD ERROR RATHER THAN A SKIP: measured before this script was
# written — asking the extractor for a step name that does not exist yields zero bytes, and running
# zero bytes of bash exits 0. A runner that did not check would report a confident PASS for a check
# that never executed, and would do so the moment anyone renamed a step or re-indented the workflow.
# That is the "check that cannot fail" defect standards/CODE-REVIEW.md forbids by name, and it would
# make this script strictly WORSE than the prose it replaces, because prose does not emit a green
# tick. Every expected step must extract non-empty or this script fails loudly, naming the step, with
# an exit code distinct from a real check failure so the two are never confused.
#
# WHY CI'S OWN SHELL FLAGS: every step in the workflow declares `shell: bash`, which in GitHub
# Actions means `bash --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail`. Running the bodies under a plain `bash`
# would be measuring with a different instrument than the one being mirrored — the results happened
# to agree on both a clean and a deliberately broken tree when tested, but agreeing by luck is not
# the same as being correct.
#
# NETWORK: not fully offline by default. The "Check file sizes" step includes the startup-context
# ratchet, which runs `git fetch --depth=1 origin main || true` to establish its baseline. That is
# one shallow fetch, it fails soft, and it is disclosed here rather than denied — an earlier version
# of the review-command prose claimed this whole set was "fully local and offline", which was false.
#
# --no-fetch SUPPRESSES that fetch (and any other `git fetch` call a step's body happens to make) by
# prepending a throwaway directory to PATH containing a `git` wrapper: it intercepts the `fetch`
# subcommand and exits 0 without contacting the network, and delegates every other subcommand to the
# real git via `exec`, untouched. This is what a read-only caller — a review subagent with no write
# permission on this repository — needs to run every check without a repository write. An earlier
# version of this flag matched `git fetch` lines by regex and rewrote them in the extracted body
# before running it; that missed several shapes a fetch invocation can take (a bare `git fetch` with
# no trailing text, `git fetch-pack`, one wrapped in `if ...; then`) and needed two separate patterns
# — one to detect, one to rewrite — to ever agree with each other. Intercepting at invocation instead
# of text is shape-agnostic by construction, and it never edits the body: "executes that verbatim"
# (WHY EXTRACTION RATHER THAN REIMPLEMENTATION, one section up) holds under --no-fetch exactly as it
# does without it.
#
# WHY THIS IS SAFE TO DO GENERICALLY, without reimplementing the ratchet's own logic: the ratchet
# already fails soft to an advisory SKIP when `origin/main` cannot be read at all (`git cat-file -s
# origin/main:...` failing sets BASE_OK=0), which is exactly the outcome an absent or never-fetched
# `origin/main` produces once the fetch is suppressed. So --no-fetch does not need its own separate
# "is origin/main resolvable" guard; the workflow body's existing one already covers it.
#
# WHAT --no-fetch DOES NOT DO: refresh a stale local `origin/main`. The ratchet's design is that
# main's tracked aggregate only ever ratchets down (see .github/workflows/pmb-health.yml), so an
# OLDER cached ref is expected to read AT LEAST AS LARGE as a fresh one — a stale ref should make the
# comparison MORE lenient, not less, and so should not manufacture a FAIL a fresh fetch would clear.
# That protection is only as good as the ratchet's own enforcement history, not a guarantee this
# script can verify on its own. Report this honestly: a suppressed fetch prints a NOTE line naming
# the step and how many fetch attempts it made — observed after the body runs, not predicted from
# its text beforehand — and the NOTE does not claim a baseline was used: the step's own output still
# reports its own SKIP if origin/main isn't resolvable, exactly as it would with the network reachable.
#
# EXIT CODES — deliberately distinct, because these mean different things:
#   0  every check passed
#   1  at least one check FAILED (the repo has a real problem)
#   2  the workflow is not present (checks were SKIPPED, nothing was verified)
#   3  a step could not be extracted (this script or the workflow is broken — NOT a clean tree)

# One list, used by both review commands. Previously each command carried its own prose list and
# the two had already drifted apart — one included Template Integrity, the other the ratchet.
