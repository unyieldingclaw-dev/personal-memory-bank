# Active Context

## Current Focus

Architecture review cycle complete (2026-05-25). All planned workstreams merged. Repo is stable. Next decision point is observation-driven: wait for 30-day startup context growth data before making classification or loader decisions.

## What Was Just Completed (2026-05-25)

**Architecture review response (4 commits on master):**
- `a62cc7b` — `.claude/worktrees/` added to `.gitignore` (accidental operational artifacts concern from review)
- PR #2 (`feat/comment-provenance`) — CODE-QUALITY.md sections 2+7, CLAUDE.md 3-line provenance anchor, Cursor rule anchor
- PR #3 (`feat/governance-integrity`) — hook scripts in templates, mb doctor Check #4 (hook presence), CI template-integrity job
- PR #4 (`feat/mb-upgrade`) — `mb upgrade` subcommand
- `a498d85` — CLAUDE.md memory update discipline: task-boundary updates, compaction summaries are fallback not primary
- `fa03b70` — `mb doctor` Startup Context observability section (files loaded, estimated tokens, top-3 contributors, 30-day growth, stale-but-loaded)

**Key architectural decisions from review:**
- Portability concern (#2) deferred: valid long-term, not actionable now without evidence
- Token budget: "observable expansion" not "enforced ceilings" — visibility first
- Identity: "governed AI operating model" confirmed, not a generic memory utility
- Contracts: empirical — observe friction before simplifying
- Sequence confirmed: (1) visibility ✅, (2) classification when data supports it, (3) loader gate only if justified

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for 30-day growth data** (~June 4) — startup context section will show real growth % once repo crosses 30-day window; use that data to decide whether classification is needed
2. **Architecture review items on hold** — boring mode (`mb init --minimal`), explicit non-goals doc, `/core` vs `/integrations` separation; none are urgent, revisit if adoption friction surfaces
3. **Semantic identity** (progress.md "Next Major Gap") — concept-level drift detection; detection-first, no auto-remediation; not yet, complexity budget is spent

## Architecture Constraints to Remember

- `confidence:` is intentionally flat (high/medium/low)
- `source_type` and `compaction_generation` are independent axes — do not conflate
- `authority` (volatility) and startup-criticality are independent axes — do not merge into one field
- Detection-first, resist-automation: auto-remediation premature without semantic certainty
- "Overhead proportionate to certainty" — governing principle for any new governance additions

## Git State
